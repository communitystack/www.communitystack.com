  MyPaint is an easy-to-use painting program which works well with Wacom graphics tablets
    and other similar devices. It comes with a large brush collection including charcoal
    and ink to emulate real media, but the highly configurable brush engine allows you
    to experiment with your own brushes and with not-quite-natural painting.
